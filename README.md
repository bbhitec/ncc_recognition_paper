# Using Normalized Cross Correlation for Object Recognition Paper

## About
##### _This is an academic paper filed under the excellence program assignment at Braude College (Karmiel, Israel) submitted August 9th 2015 imported here as a portfolio piece._

This paper explores the advantages and the flaws of using NCC for sub-patterns recognition. Also attached is a MATLAB file `brochure_test.m` used to run the different NCC testing and acquire the conclusions in the paper. It can be used to play around with NCC!
